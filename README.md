# Fake-Reviews-Detection
## A Machine Learning model containing two algorithms to classify the user reviews in real or fake.

This project is based on **Supervised Learning Techniques** and **Natural Language Processing** Techniques used to build model based on a textual dataset.

1. Various Data Visualization methods were implemented to visualize the data.
2. Multiple Data Preprocessing step were implemented to make the data ready for model building.
3. Two Machine Learning Model a. Support Vector Machine & b. Random Forest were used.
(The models gave accuracy of 95.21 & 89.77 respectively)

**(Note : The dataset is available on the Kaggle's website or the link in the text document can be followed.)**
